Mediviewer our first hackathon project.

ABOUT THE APPLICATION With MediViewer, patients can easily access comprehensive details about the medications prescribed by their doctors, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health. With a simple scan, patients can learn about the purpose, dosage, side effects, and interactions of each medication, empowering them to take control of their health.

THE PROBLEM Patients often receive prescriptions with medication names they may not fully understand. Lack of information about prescribed medicines can lead to confusion, medication errors, and potential health risks.
